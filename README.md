Patch to make GUN GODZ playable on PS Vita

###

## Disclaimer
This patch does not contain any game files from GUN GODZ. **You need the game files from your legally owned copy**.
If you don't have a copy of the game, you can get it from free [HERE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/522940/GUN_GODZ/)

## Instructions (Read them carefully)
1. Download the VPK and install it on your hacked PS Vita
2. In your PC, open the folder when you have installed GUN GODZ (Steam only at the moment).
3. Download the patch for your version and extract it in that folder. After that, run `apply_patch.bat`. This will create a folder called `Patched_Files`
4. If everything went correctly, your Patched_Files folders will have a file called `eboot.bin` and a folder called `games` with a `game.win` file.
5. Copy `eboot.bin` and the `games` folder and move them to the vita, `ux0:app/GUNGODZ00`. Overwrite when prompted. 
6. Copy every `.ogg` file from your Steam's GUN GODZ folder to `ux0:app/GUNGODZ00/games`
7. Optional but highly recommended: Overclock to 444mhz or 500mhz the CPU to improve framerate on some areas. Use PSV Shell.
